# gravitas 0.1.2

This is a maintenance release due to the changes in tsibble_0.8.6.

## Bug fixes

* gran_obs: Specifically, see the warnings about 'Documented arguments not in
\usage' in the r-devel checks.  These are from a recent bug fix
(PR#16223, see
<https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16223>): can you
please fix your man pages as necessary?  (In most cases, remove the
documentation for argument '...'.)
